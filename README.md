# hogsurvey
- Posthog survey response analysis using Gemini. This works for the 'freeform' survey type with just a text input.
- This sort of survey is open ended and using LLM may unlock new insights.
- A useful way to quickly have up to date summary of survey responses, and run a huge variety of analyses just by changing the system prompt.

- Install google-generativeai before running, and add your Posthog API Key, Project ID, and Gemini API Key.
- See posthog docs for how to get project id.
- Modify system-instruction to change output.
